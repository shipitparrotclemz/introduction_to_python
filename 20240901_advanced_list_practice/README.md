## Q1: Find the median of an even or odd length list (assumed sorted ascendingly)

##### Test Case 1:

Given an even length list, take the average of the two items in the center

```python3
my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The two items in your center will be 2 and 3

The median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`

##### Test Case 2:

Given an odd lenfgth list, take the center item as the median

```python3
my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
```

The median is `2`
