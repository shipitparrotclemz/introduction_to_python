# Define your first integer
# Creating a block of memory, storing 10 on your computer
# And assign the address of that 10, to your my_int (Which is another block of memory)
# Think of my_int as a piece of paper, containing the address to 10
# and 10 is living somewhere in your computer
my_int: int = 10
