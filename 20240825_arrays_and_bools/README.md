# Objective

## Practice List and Bool

### 1. How to check the length of a list

Concept: `len`

### 2. How to check if a number is even or odd

Concept: `length % 2 == 0` to check if length is even

Concept: `length % 2 == 1` to check if length is odd

### 3. How to check if the length of a list is even or odd

Concept: Combine 1 and 2

Concept: `len(my_list) % 2 == 0` to check if length of list is even

Concept: `len(my_list) % 2 == 1` to check if length of list is odd

### 4. How to access a single item in a list by index

Concept: `my_list[0]` to access item at first position

### 5. How to get the center index of a list with floor operator (`//`)

Concept: `len(my_list) // 2` to get center index

### 6. How to access the middle item of a list

Concept: Combine 4 and 5

Concept: `my_list[len(my_list) // 2]`

### 7. How to get the median of an even or odd length list

Concept: Combine 1 to 6
