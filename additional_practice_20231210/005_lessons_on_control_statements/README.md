# Practices on Control Statements

## Challenge 1: If-Else Statement
- Define an integer object `num` and assign its value to `10`
- Implement an if-else statement to check if `num` is greater than `5`
  - If true, print "Number is greater than 5"
  - Else, print "Number is not greater than 5"

```commandline
python3 001_if_else_statement.py 
Number is greater than 5
```

## Challenge 2: Nested If-Else Statement
- Define an integer object age and assign its value to 18
- Implement a nested if-else statement to check if age is greater than 18 or equal to 18
- If greater, print "You are an adult"
- Else if equal, print "You are a teenager"
- Else, print "You are a child"

```commandline
python3 002_nested_if_else_statement.py 
You are a teenager
```

## Challenge 3: If-Elif-Else Statement
- Define an integer object marks and assign its value to 85
- Implement an if-elif-else statement to determine the grade based on marks
- If marks is greater than or equal to 90, print "Grade A"
- Else if marks is greater than or equal to 80, print "Grade B"
- Else if marks is greater than or equal to 70, print "Grade C"
- Else, print "Grade D"

```commandline
python3 003_if_elif_else_statement.py 
Grade B
```

## Challenge 4: For Loop
- Implement a for loop to print integers from 1 to 5

```commandline
python3 004_for_loop.py 
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Challenge 5: Nested For Loop
- Implement a nested for loop to print a pattern:

```txt
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

```commandline
python3 005_nested_for_loop.py 
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## Challenge 6: While Loop
- Define an integer object count and assign its value to 0
- Implement a while loop to print numbers from 0 to 4

```commandline
python3 006_while_loop.py 
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Challenge 7: Break Statement
- Implement a for loop to print integers from 1 to 10 but break the loop when reaching 5

```commandline
python3 007_break_statement.py
1
2
3
4
```

## Challenge 8: Continue Statement
- Implement a for loop to print odd numbers from 1 to 10, but skip printing 5

```commandline
python3 008_continue_statement.py 
1
3
7
9
```

## Challenge 9: Pass Statement
- Implement a function my_function that does nothing but prints "This is a placeholder function"
- Use the pass statement to define the function without implementing any code

```commandline
python3 009_pass_statement.py 
This is a placeholder function
```

## Challenge 10: Range Function in For Loop
- Implement a for loop using the range function to print numbers from 10 to 20 in steps of 2

```commandline
python3 010_range_function.py 
10
12
14
16
18
20
```
