# Practices on `bool`

## Challenge 1: Defining a `bool`
- Define a boolean object (`True`) and assign its value to a variable named `my_bool`
- Print it

### Challenge 1: Expected Answer

```commandline
python3 001_defining_a_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 2: Using Comparison Operators
- Define two integer objects 10 and 5 and assign their values to variables named num1 and num2 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if num1 is greater than num2 using the > operator and assign it to a variable named greater_than
- Print greater_than

```commandline
python3 002_comparison_operators_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 3: Logical Operators
- Define two boolean objects True and False and assign their values to variables named bool1 and bool2 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if both bool1 and bool2 are True using the and operator and assign it to a variable named both_true
- Print both_true

```
python3 003_logical_operators_bool.py 
False
```

## Challenge 4: Combining Logical and Comparison Operators
- Define three integer objects 8, 4, and 10 and assign their values to variables named num1, num2, and num3 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if num1 multiplied by num2 is greater than num3 using a combination of *, >, and and operators and assign it to a variable named result
- Print result

```commandline
python3 004_logical_comparison_combination_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 5: Negating a Boolean Value
- Define a boolean object False and assign its value to a variable named my_bool
- Negate my_bool using the not operator and assign it to a variable named negated_bool
- Print negated_bool

```commandline
python3 005_negating_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 6: Checking for Equality
- Define two string objects "hello" and "Hello" and assign their values to variables named str1 and str2 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if str1 is equal to str2 using the == operator and assign it to a variable named equal
- Print equal

```commandline
python3 006_checking_equality_bool.py 
False
```

## Challenge 7: Checking for Inequality
- Define two integer objects 10 and 5 and assign their values to variables named num1 and num2 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if num1 is not equal to num2 using the != operator and assign it to a variable named not_equal
- Print not_equal

```commandline
python3 007_checking_inequality_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 8: Combining Logical Operators
- Define three boolean objects True, False, and True and assign their values to variables named bool1, bool2, and bool3 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if either bool1 or bool2 is True, and bool3 is False using the or, and operators and assign it to a variable named result
- Print result

```commandline
python3 008_combining_logical_operators_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 9: Checking for Membership
- Define a string object "Python" and assign its value to a variable named my_str
- Define a boolean object that checks if "th" is present in my_str using the in operator and assign it to a variable named is_present
- Print is_present

```commandline
python3 009_check_membership_bool.py 
True
```

## Challenge 10: Checking for Empty Values
- Define an empty list [] and assign it to a variable named empty_list
- Define a boolean object that checks if empty_list is empty using the not operator and assign it to a variable named is_empty
- Print is_empty

```commandline
python3 010_check_empty_values_bool.py 
True
```
