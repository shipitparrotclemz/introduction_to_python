## Challenge 4: Combining Logical and Comparison Operators
- Define three integer objects 8, 4, and 10 and assign their values to variables named num1, num2, and num3 respectively
- Define a boolean object that checks if num1 multiplied by num2 is greater than num3 using a combination of *, >, and and operators and assign it to a variable named result
- Print result
