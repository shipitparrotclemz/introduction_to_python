Challenge 4: Creating two ints and multiplying the first int by the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third integer object as the product of `first_int` and `second_int` with the `*` operator
  - Assign it to a variable named `third_int`
- Print it

first_int: int = 10
second_int: int = 10
third_int: int = first_int * second_int
print(third_int)
