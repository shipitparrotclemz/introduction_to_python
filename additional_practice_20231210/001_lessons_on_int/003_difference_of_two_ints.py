Challenge 3: Creating two ints and minus the first int with the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third integer object as the difference of `first_int` and `second_int` with the `-` operator
  - Assign it's address to a variable named `third_int`
- Print it
