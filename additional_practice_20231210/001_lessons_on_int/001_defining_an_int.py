Challenge 1:
- Define an integer object (`10`) and assign it's address to a variable named `my_int`
- print it

The statement below does two things
- It creates `10` as an object, and saves it on our machine, at an address e.g 0x123
- It creates my_int as a variable, storing the address of where `10` is created (0x123)
"""
my_int: int = 10

"""
We then print the integer object (`10`)
"""
print(my_int)
