Challenge 5: Creating two ints and dividing the first int by the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third float object as the result of `first_int` divided by `second_int` with the `/` operator
  - Assign it to a variable named `third_float`
- Print it
"""

first_int: int = 10
second_int: int = 10
third_float: float = first_int / second_int
print(third_float)
