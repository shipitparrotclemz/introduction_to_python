# Practices on `int`

## Challenge 1: Defining an `int`
- Define an integer object (`10`) and assign it's address to a variable named `my_int`
- print it

### Challenge 1: Expected Answer

```commandline
python3 001_defining_an_int.py
10
```

## Challenge 2: Creating two ints and adding them
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third integer object as the sum of `first_int` and `second_int` with the `+` operator
  - Assign it's address to a variable named `third_int`

### Challenge 2: Expected Answer

```commandline
python3 002_adding_two_ints.py
20
```

## Challenge 3: Creating two ints and minus the first int with the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it's address to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third integer object as the difference of `first_int` and `second_int` with the `-` operator
  - Assign it's address to a variable named `third_int`

```commandline
python3 003_difference_of_two_ints.py 
0
```

## Challenge 4: Creating two ints and multiplying the first int by the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third integer object as the product of `first_int` and `second_int` with the `*` operator
  - Assign it to a variable named `third_int`
- Print it

```commandline
python3 004_product_of_two_ints.py 
100
```

## Challenge 5: Creating two ints and dividing the first int by the second int
- Define a first integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `first_int`
- Define a second integer object `10` and assign it to a variable named `second_int`
- Define a third float object as the result of `first_int` divided by `second_int` with the `/` operator
  - Assign it to a variable named `third_float`
- Print it

```commandline
python3 005_division_of_one_int_with_the_second.py 
1.0
```

## Challenge 6: Finding the remainder of two integers
- Define a first integer object 15 and assign it to a variable named first_int
- Define a second integer object 7 and assign it to a variable named second_int
- Define a third integer object as the remainder of first_int divided by second_int using the % operator
- Assign it to a variable named remainder_int
- Print it

```commandline
python3 006_modulus_of_one_int_with_the_second.py 
1
```
