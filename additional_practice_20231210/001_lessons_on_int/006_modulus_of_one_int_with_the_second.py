## Challenge 6: Finding the remainder of two integers
- Define a first integer object 15 and assign it to a variable named first_int
- Define a second integer object 7 and assign it to a variable named second_int
- Define a third integer object as the remainder of first_int divided by second_int using the % operator
- Assign it to a variable named remainder_int
- Print it
