## Challenge 3: Creating two floats and subtracting the second float from the first float
- Define a first floating-point object 8.9 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 3.7 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the difference between first_float and second_float with the - operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
