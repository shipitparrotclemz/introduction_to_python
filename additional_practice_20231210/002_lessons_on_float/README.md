# Practices on `float`

## Challenge 1: Defining a `float`
- Define a floating-point object (`10.0`) and assign its value to a variable named `my_float`
- Print it

### Challenge 1: Expected Answer

```commandline
python3 001_defining_a_float.py
10.0
```

## Challenge 2: Creating two floats and adding them
- Define a first floating-point object 10.5 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 5.2 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the sum of first_float and second_float with the + operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it

```commandline
python3 002_adding_two_floats.py  
15.7
```

## Challenge 3: Creating two floats and subtracting the second float from the first float
- Define a first floating-point object 8.9 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 3.7 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the difference between first_float and second_float with the - operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it

```commandline
python3 003_subtracting_two_floats.py 
5.2
```

## Challenge 4: Creating two floats and multiplying the first float by the second float
- Define a first floating-point object 5.2 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 3.0 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the product of first_float and second_float with the * operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it

```commandline
python3 004_multiplying_two_floats.py 
15.600000000000001
```

## Challenge 5: Creating two floats and dividing the first float by the second float
- Define a first floating-point object 20.0 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 4.0 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third float object as the result of first_float divided by second_float with the / operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it

```commandline
python3 005_division_of_one_float_with_the_second.py 
5.0
```

## Challenge 6: Finding the modulo of two floats
- Define a first floating-point object 17.5 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 4.3 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third float object as the modulo of first_float divided by second_float using the % operator
- Assign its value to a variable named modulo_float
- Print it

```commandline
python3 006_modulo_of_two_floats.py 
0.3000000000000007
```
