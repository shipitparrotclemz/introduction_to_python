## Challenge 4: Creating two floats and multiplying the first float by the second float
- Define a first floating-point object 5.2 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 3.0 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the product of first_float and second_float with the * operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it
