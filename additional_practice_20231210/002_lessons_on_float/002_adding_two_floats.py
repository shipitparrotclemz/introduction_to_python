Challenge 2: Creating two floats and adding them
- Define a first floating-point object 10.5 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 5.2 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third floating-point object as the sum of first_float and second_float with the + operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
