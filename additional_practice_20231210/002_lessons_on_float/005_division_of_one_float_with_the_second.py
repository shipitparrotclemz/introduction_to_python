## Challenge 5: Creating two floats and dividing the first float by the second float
- Define a first floating-point object 20.0 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 4.0 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third float object as the result of first_float divided by second_float with the / operator
- Assign its value to a variable named third_float
- Print it
