## Challenge 6: Finding the modulo of two floats
- Define a first floating-point object 17.5 and assign its value to a variable named first_float
- Define a second floating-point object 4.3 and assign its value to a variable named second_float
- Define a third float object as the modulo of first_float divided by second_float using the % operator
- Assign its value to a variable named modulo_float
- Print it
